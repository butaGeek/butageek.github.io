## Code formatter/syntax highlighter

**atom-beautify**

[atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) is the very first package I installed. It supports almost all popular language highlighting and formatting. Some of them need additional packages to make it work, but you can easily find them either on Atom packages page or on GitHub.

### Language support

#### PHP support

In order to support PHP, atom-beautify requires [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to be installed.

First, go [here](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/releases/) to download the latest version.

Switch to your download location in command-line and rename the file first (you have to rename it as follows because atom-beautify will try to locate the file using the exact same name):

```
$ mv php-cs-fixer.phar php-cs-fixer
```

Then make the file executable:

```
$ chmod a+x php-cs-fixer
```

Now move the file to somewhere that is included in your `$PATH`. Here we'll use `/usr/local/bin` to make the file globally accessible:

```
$ sudo mv php-cs-fixer /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you're good to go.
