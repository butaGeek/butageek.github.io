[ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) is a new version of ECMAScript standard released in June 2015. It is a significant update since ES5 standardized in 2009.<!--excerpt-->

Since it's still relatively new, implementation in major platforms/browsers is still underway. To know more details of the progress, check this [compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

Due to the incomplete support to ES6, for now we need a transpiler to convert js files from ES6 to ES5. The transpiler we are using here is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The most important feature ES6 brings us is the long-awaited module support, but unfortunately till now no browser supports modules natively, so we need a bundler to bundle all of the required dependencies into a single JavaScript file. The bundler we are using is [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Hands-on

### Install http server

We need an http server to test our local html file because otherwise you will get an `XMLHttpRequest cannot load` error, the description being `Cross origin requests...` in your browser console.

Basically, it's because of the security feature of the modern browsers. They are programed to watch for cross site attacks and will block requests to files on your local hard drives. Thus comes the local server.

Here we are using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to serve as our http server:

```
$ npm install --save-dev live-server
```

### Prepare environment

Let's create a project folder first:

```
$ mkdir es6-demo
$ cd es6-demo
```

Create a [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file:

```
$ npm init -y
```

This will create a npm config file similar to this:

```json
{
  "name": "es6-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Create folder `src` to contain our source files:

```
$ mkdir src
```

Create folder `build` to contain our compiled files:

```
$ mkdir build
```

Create source js files and index file:

```
$ touch src/{entry,lib}.js index.html
```

Update `index.html` as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>ES6 Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="build/bundle.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Use Webpack

Install webpack:

```
$ npm install --save-dev webpack
```

Update `src/lib.js` as follows:

```js
var sum = function(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
};

module.exports = {
    sum: sum
};
```

Update `src/entry.js` as follows:

```js
var calc = require('./lib.js');
console.log(calc.sum(2, 3));
```

Update the `scripts` section in `package.json` to add a new script to call webpack:

```
"webpack": "webpack ./src/entry.js ./build/bundle.js"
```

Run following command to bundle scripts:

```
$ npm run webpack
```

Now you'll see a new file called `bundle.js` created under folder `build`.

In order to test the code, add another new script to the `scripts` section in `package.json`:

```
"start": "live-server"
```

Then run following command to start our server:

```
$ npm start
```

Right upon the server is running, it'll open a new browser page which is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. You can go to Developer tools > Console tab to check out the output, it should log number `5`.

### Use Babel

Install Babel:

```
$ npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-core babel-preset-es2015
```

Create ES6 style js file:

```
$ touch src/es6-lib.js
```

Update the file as follows:

```js
let sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
let square = (num) => num * num;

export {
    sum,
    square
};
```

Add a script to `package.json` to run `babel` cli:

```
"babel": "babel --presets es2015 ./src/es6-lib.js -o ./build/es6-lib.js"
```

Run it with:

```
$ npm run babel
```

Now you'll see a new converted `es6-lib.js` file under `build` folder. You can see that the converted version is basically a ES5 file.

### Use Webpack to do both

The `es6-lib.js` file we converted earlier is still not usable because it still needs to be bundled with the `entry.js` file.

Now we'll talk about how to use Webpack together with Babel to convert and bundle ES6 files at the same time.

Create `webpack.config.js` in the root of the project:

```
$ touch webpack.config.js
```

Update the file as follows:

```js
var path = require('path');
var webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
  context: __dirname + "/src",
  entry: "./entry.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      query: {
        presets: ['es2015']
      }
    }]
  },
  stats: {
    colors: true
  },
  devtool: 'source-map'
};
```

Install the loaders for transpiling with Babel:

```
$ npm install --save-dev babel-loader
```

Since we now have the Webpack config file, we don't need to specify the params in the `webpack` script in `package.json` anymore.

Change the corresponding script from:

```
"webpack": "webpack ./src/entry.js ./build/bundle.js"
```

to:

```
"webpack": "webpack"
```

Now update `entry.js` in ES6 style:

```js
import * as calc from './es6-lib.js';
console.log(calc.sum(2, 3));
console.log(calc.square(4));
```

Run script to convert and bundle js files:

```
$ npm run webpack
```

Let's go back to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to check the console log. It should now output `5` and `16`.
